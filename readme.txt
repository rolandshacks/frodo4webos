Frodo for webOS is a port of the free Commodore C64 emulator Frodo
by Christian Bauer.

Frodo is a highly portable program and currently has versions for Windows, Mac,
Linux/Unix, Playstation, Dreamcast and Symbian telephones to mention just a
few. Now webOS users can join the fun!

Frodo is distributed under the GPL (Gnu Public License), which means that not
only is it 100% free, the source code is included along with the program.
You can modify the code in any way you please, as long as the result is also
published under the GPL.
